Title: On Multivariate Feature Selection with Genetic Algorithms
Version: 0.1.1
Author: Andrew Ma, James Hall, and Sky Qui 
Maintainer: Andrew Ma <andrew_c_ma@berkeley.edu>
Description: This package provides a genetic algorithm to identify optimal features 
    for linear regression under R's LM and
    GLM models. Users are able to set 
    multiple parameters for the genetic 
    algorithm and request optimization via 
    R2, AIC, BIC, AICc or a user defined
    function. The algorithm can process 
    these score functions in parallel
    on a single machine with the 
    parallel = TRUE argument.
